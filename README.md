# To-Do-List
The to-do list website allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks. Users can add new tasks, remove completed ones, and mark tasks as completed. The website also stores the to-do list data in cache, ensuring that users can access their lists even after closing their browsers or refreshing the page.
